# AJ's ASTEROIDS
A Game for the Grand Aj of Scrutton

I highly recommend you play until you reach 10,000 points! There is a super secret! Please play it before you look at the code!

If it fails to build on your end check you have the right version of Unity. Also, trust that it works on my computer!
I'll be more than happy to skype chat about the game.
