# AJ's ASTEROIDS
A Game for the Grand Aj of Scrutton

If it fails to build on your end check you have the right version of Unity. Also, trust that it works on my computer!
I'll be more than happy to skype chat about the game.

Also, I highly recommend you play until you reach 10,000 points! There is a super secret!
